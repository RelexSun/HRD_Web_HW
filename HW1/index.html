          <b>Koh Rong</b> is the biggest of the islands off the coast of Sihanoukville in the Gulf of Thailand. It
          stretches from
          south-east to north-west, is roughly elongate shaped and it encompasses an area of <em><u><mark>78
                km<sup>2</sup>
                (30 sq
                mi)</mark></u></em>. The
          terrain is
          predominantly hilly with a sizable mountain <em><u><mark> 316 m (1,037 ft)</mark></u></em> at the island's
          north-west. The hills provide water
          for
          countless creeks and estuaries. The island's interior is almost completely forested, concealing a number of
          seasonal
          waterfalls. <b>Koh Rong</b> has around <em><u><mark>43 km (27 mi) </mark></u></em> of delicate beaches. There
          are
          no less
          than 23 beaches of varying
          length and coloration—from (predominantly) white to beige to rose-colored sands—along most of the coastline.
          Bays,
          protruding capes and impressive sandstone rock formations contribute to the island's scenic panorama. The
          southern
          coastline, exposed to the weather and open sea, is particularly spectacular, whereas the eastern coast, which
          faces
          towards the land, is characterized by a sequence of smooth hills, gently sloping towards the numerous
          crescent-shaped beaches, inlets and bays. Several small islets and many reefs provide an abundance of natural
          environments for a great variety of marine life. The center of the island is a flat "belt" of sediments that
          joins
          the two hilly massifs of the south-east and north-west. Here is a small savanna—the result of human activities
          and
          cultivation.

        <p>The main tourist area on <b>Koh Rong</b> is known for its cheap alcohol, cheap accommodation
          <mark>($15+ / night)</mark>, loud music, and late nights. It is an ideal destination for anyone looking
          for a "party atmosphere" on a tropical island paradise.</p>

        <p>
          What's great about <b>Long Set (4K) Beach</b>, apart from the stunning scenery and inviting pristine waters,
          is that it's a short walk away from the main tourist area on Koh Rong (Koh Touch). If you head past Paradise
          Bungalows and White Beach Bungalows on your left hand side, the next resort is Tree House. Keep walking
          following the beach area around, and you will pass a new resort called Star Fish. At times you will need to go
          off the actual beach itself into the forest, but the path is very easy to follow. After about <mark>15
            minutes</mark> you
          will walk out onto a large beach expanse (about 4km or so - hence the name '4K') with very little development
          (though new resorts are currently being built).

      </h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          <b>Sok San Beach (ឆ្នេរសុខសាន)</b>, also known as Long Beach, is a 7km long sandy White beach located on the
          westem coast of Koh Rong Island. People may have seen this beach before as it has featured on the Survivor
          series and the Sok San Resort was actually constructed for the purpose of housing staff and crew related to
          the production. Sok San Resort is one of the many accommodation options along the beach. More about
          accommodation options further below. The 7km long beach features Sok San Port (cituBANg) at its northern end
          which is surrounded by a few shops and restaurants after which it is basically 7km of unbroken sand white
          beach. The beachfront is nicest around Sok San Resort, Royal Sands, and Long Beach Resort as they actively
          keep their private frontage clean and neat. Other sections of the beach can collect odd rubbish that is either
          lef or washes ashore.

        <p>
          Things to do along Soksan beach are mostly centered on simply enjoying what is (currently) a not overly
          developed, beautiful beach, with aqua azure waters. Long beach walks are a must taking in the different
          scenery and even stopping by the bars at the other bungalows/resorts for refresher along the way. Sunsets are
          spectacular. Other activities include swimming, pier fishing, snorkeling, kayaking or renting a bike and
          exploring the island trails through the native jungle. Also not to be missed is the bioluminescent plankton
          seen along the ocean's edge at night. If you are on an extended stay, you can also join in on island hopping
          tours which your resort can organize for you. Scuba diving tours are another option. If you are not already
          staying there, you can also walk along the beach to one of the upscale resorts and splurge on yourself by
          enjoying spa services, massage, gym, pool, bar, and their restaurants.
